            <p>Component communication in Angular involves sharing data between Angular components.</p>
            <p>There are several methods for component communication, including Input and Output properties, ViewChild and ContentChild decorators, and shared services.</p>

            <p>ngIf and ngShow are both Angular directives used for conditionally displaying elements in the DOM.</p>
            <ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; gap: 4px;">
                <li><strong>ngIf:</strong> Removes or recreates the element in the DOM based on a condition. When the condition is false, the element is removed from the DOM. When the condition is true, the element is added to the DOM.</li>
                <li><strong>ngShow:</strong> Hides or shows the element based on a condition using CSS display property. When the condition is false, the element is hidden by setting its display property to none. When the condition is true, the element is shown by setting its display property to its original value.</li>

            <p>Angular pipes are used for data transformation within templates.</p>
            <p>They allow developers to transform data before displaying it in the view. Angular provides several built-in pipes for common tasks such as formatting dates, numbers, and currency.</p>

            <p>Injectable services in Angular are classes that are decorated with the Injectable() decorator.</p>

            <p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself.</p>
            <p>In Angular, DI is used to provide instances of services to components, directives, pipes, and other services.</p>

            <p>Host listener and host binding are Angular decorators used to listen to events and bind properties on the host element of a directive.</p>
            <p>Host listener is used to listen to events such as mouse clicks, keyboard events, etc., while host binding is used to bind properties of the host element.</p>

            <p>One-way data binding refers to the flow of data from the component class to the template (view).</p>
            <p>Two-way data binding refers to the synchronization of data between the component class and the template. Changes in the template update the component class and vice versa.</p>

            <p>Route guards in Angular are used to control access to routes in an Angular application.</p>
            <p>Auth guards specifically ensure that only authenticated users are allowed to access certain routes. They can be used to redirect unauthorized users to a login page or display a forbidden message.</p>

            <p>Lazy loading is a technique in Angular where modules are loaded asynchronously, on-demand, rather than upfront when the application starts.</p>
            <p>It helps improve the initial loading time of the application by only loading the necessary modules when they are required.</p>

            <p>Template-driven forms and reactive forms are two approaches for handling forms in Angular.</p>
            <p>Template-driven forms rely on directives in the template, while reactive forms use reactive programming with FormControl, FormGroup, and FormBuilder classes.</p>

            <p>Observable and Promises are both used for handling asynchronous operations in Angular.</p>
            <p>Observables are streams of data that can be subscribed to, while Promises represent a single future value or error that will be resolved asynchronously.</p>
